# Fairbuds EQ Tool

Test tool for the reverse-engineered Fairbuds GATT protocol.

At least subjectively, the expanded neq capabilities significantly improve the sound compared to what's possible with the app itself, especially in the high end.

## Features

- Set EQ presets (Main, Bass, Flat, Studio)
- More EQ control
  - −12 to +13.5 dB per band (vs. app limited ±10 dB)
  - Customisable Q-factor (vs. app hardcoded 0.7)
- Load parametric EQ files generated by AutoEQ
- Battery level monitoring
- Interactive CLI with command history

## Quick start

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/user/fairbuds.git
cd fairbuds
```

If you already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Install with uv

This project uses the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package manager. To install it, run:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# macOS with brew
brew install uv

# Or with pipx
pipx install uv
```

Then install the dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Finding Your Fairbuds BLE Address

The BLE address **might be different** to the audio (BR/EDR) address shown in Bluetooth settings.

```bash
# Start BLE scan
uv run fairbuds --scan

# Look for your Fairbuds in the list, e.g.:
#   00:11:22:33:44:55    -96 dBm  Fairbuds
# macOS:
#   A1F7C2D9-4B8E-9A3F-16D2-7C5B8E0F4A12    ?? dBm  Fairbuds
```

## Usage

```bash
uv run fairbuds --help
```

Type `help` in the interactive CLI for more details on available commands. If you just want to try the best preset, type:

```
load rtings_studio
```

### Command-line options

```bash
uv run fairbuds --version           # Show version
uv run fairbuds --scan              # Scan and list BLE devices
uv run fairbuds --list-presets      # List available AutoEQ presets
uv run fairbuds 00:11:22:33:44:55   # Connect to device
```

## Project structure

- `AutoEq/` – AutoEQ (submodule)
- `pex/` – Parametric EQ configs for AutoEQ
  - `fairbuds.yaml` – uses the full EQ capabilities
  - `fairbuds-app.yaml` – equivalent to the official app
- `presets/` – Parametric EQ presets
- `measurements/` – Useful Fairbuds response curve measurements
- `src/` – Source code for this project

Please keep in mind that this project is a quick-and-dirty experiment and most of the Python code was vibe-coded. There is not much point in making it more robust; it served only to test the protocol before attempting Gadgetbridge support.

Don't read too much into the code. The AI reads a bit too much into instructions and is very eager to change them into code with even more helpful comments. But the core implementation (EQ switching, custom EQ's battery info) should be correct.

### Measurements

`Fairphone Fairbuds.csv` contains RTINGS measurement of the “Main” preset on the 5128. This seems to be the best base for experimentation. Use the “JM-1 with Harman filters” target for best results.

The rest are from DHRME on the 711 for use with the “AutoEq in-ear” target. I had mixed results even though they also measured the “Studio” EQ, possibly due to differences in the firmware.

Some of these measurements are from AutoEq's database, the missing ones I preprocessed myself from the raw CSV files.

### Presets

See comments in each preset. Unfortunately we currently do not have enough data for a definitive preset. My favourite so far is `rtings_studio.txt`, but its construction is a bit fishy.

It's created by simply adding the following two presets band-by-band:

1. `main-ish.txt` – my by-ear approximation to match the “Main” preset from “Studio”
2. `rtings.txt` - based on RTINGS measurements of the “Main” preset

This is of course speculative at best. `main-ish` does not match “Main” perfectly and `rtings_studio` also uses variable Q-factors. But as an approximation it works well enough.

### Q-values

The Q-values in the app are hardcoded to `7`.

The actual interpretation is undocumented (if any calculations were present, they were most likely optimised out). This tool assumes the final Q-value is `n/10`.

This would mean the default is 0.7 with a range of 0.1–25.5, which is reasonable. It would also match the Fairbuds XL's 2023 default value (which is directly visible in the decompiled code).

Changing this value manually seems to affect the sound seemingly linearly, with the full range affecting the sound. But ultimately, it results in a meaningful improvement to the sound, so for now it's _good enough_.

It is worth mentioning though that [manually calculating](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/wiki/Custom-Parametric-Eq#custom-graphic-equalizer) the value for the given bands would bring it closer to 1.2.

## Generating AutoEQ presets

Follow the setup in the AutoEq README. Then use the parametric equalizer presets in `pex/`.

```bash
cd AutoEq
python -m autoeq \
    --input-file="measurements/rtings/data/in-ear/Bruel & Kjaer 5128/Fairphone Fairbuds.csv" \
    --output-dir="../results" \
    --target="targets/JM-1 with Harman filters.csv" \
    --max-gain=12 \
    --parametric-eq \
    --parametric-eq-config=../pex/fairbuds.yaml \
    --fs=48000 \
    --bass-boost=6.5 \
    --preamp=-4
```

For bass boost, I use the default on the AutoEq [web app](https://autoeq.app/) for the given target.

Manually adjust the max gain depending on how much volume you are willing to lose, and manually tune the preamp to avoid audio quality loss without leading to overflows during calculation.

## Protocol
